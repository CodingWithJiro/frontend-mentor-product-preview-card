This project is a responsive product preview card that visually replicates a Chanel perfume ad. It's built entirely with semantic HTML and modern CSS. Dark mode is supported, and accessibility best practices were applied.

Created as part of the building challenges from [Frontend Mentor](https://www.frontendmentor.io/).

## üîç Overview

This site features a single, centered product card layout inspired by a JPG design from Frontend Mentor. It demonstrates practical use of HTML structure, mobile-first responsive design, modern CSS techniques (custom properties, media queries, dark mode), and ARIA for accessibility.

The project was built without access to a Figma file (premium feature), so the layout was matched pixel-by-pixel using the [PerfectPixel](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/perfectpixel-by-welldonecod/dkaagdgjmgdmbnecmcefdhjekcoceebi) browser extension ‚Äî a great exercise in visual accuracy and layout precision.
